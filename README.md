Peer Comment: Nice work, Liam! The code works as expected. I was able to access the endpoint via Postman and post a variety of inputs. If I could give some suggestions to clean it up a little, you can remove the NameController() function on lines 10-13 since that doesn't seem to be doing anything. You can also remove the input variable all together from line 8 and line 21 and simply return the inputName variable inside your return string on line 22 to simplify the code. Other than that, nice work!
